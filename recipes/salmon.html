            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>A relatively healthy and tasty option you can always easily call on is pan-fried salmon! I personally eat salmon a majority of the time when I am cooking at home.</p>
                <p>This salmon recipe is a quick and easy way to pan-fry your fish. It will only take about 10 minutes and serves 4.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 (6-oz.) salmon fillets, patted dry with a paper towel</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt</li>
                    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>Juice of 1 1/2 lemons, divided</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
                    <li>Pinch red pepper flakes</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
                    <li>1 lemon, cut into rounds, for serving</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp. freshly chopped dill, for garnish</li>
                </ul>


            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. When oil is hot but not smoking, add salmon skin-side up and season with salt and pepper. Cook salmon until deeply golden, about 6 minutes, then flip over..</li>
                    <li>Add juice of 1 lemon, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer and cook, basting salmon occasionally with a spoon. When salmon is opaque, remove from skillet. Add butter and remaining lemon juice to pan and whisk to combine with the sauce. Let simmer until thickened slightly, 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Serve fish drizzled with pan sauce and topped with fresh lemon slices and dill.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Hey, you kinda look like me now...</p>
                <p>If you are saving the salmon for a bear encounter, uh... good luck. Otherwise, if you are storing the fish for normal purposes like meal prep, it can be refrigerated in an air-tight container for up to 4 days, or kept frozen for up to 6 months!</p>
