                    <li>1 teaspoon salt, to taste</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon pepper, to taste</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons avocado oil</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
                    <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
                    <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
                </ul>


            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 200°F/95°C.</li>
                    <li>Pat the steak dry with a paper towel, and generously season all sides of the steak with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to a wire rack on top of a baking sheet, and bake for about 45 minutes to an hour, until the internal temperature reads about 125°F/50˚C for medium-rare. Adjust the bake time if you like your steak more rare or well-done.</li>
                    <li>Heat the avocado oil in a pan over high heat until smoking.</li>
                    <li>Sear the steak for 1 minute on one side, then flip.</li>
                    <li>Add the butter, garlic, rosemary, and thyme, and swirl around the pan. Transfer the garlic and herbs on top of the steak and baste the steak with the butter using a large spoon.</li>
                    <li>Baste for about 1 minute, then flip the steak with tongs and baste the other side for about 15 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Turn the steak on its side and cook to render off any excess fat.</li>
                    <li>Remove the steak from the pan and let rest for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
